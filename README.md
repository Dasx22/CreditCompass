# CreditCompass

CreditCompass is a Machine Learning model designed to categorize loan applicants into one of four distinct risk profiles: P1, P2, P3, or P4. This categorization is based on various financial factors, including CIBIL score and existing pending loans.

## Overview

In the lending industry, accurately assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants is crucial for managing risk and making informed decisions. CreditCompass automates this process by leveraging machine learning to analyze key financial indicators and assign a risk category to each applicant.

## Features

* **Applicant Categorization:** Assigns loan applicants to one of four categories (P1 - P4), indicating their risk level.
* **Factor-Based Analysis:** Utilizes important financial metrics such as CIBIL score, pending loans, and other relevant data.
* **Machine Learning Powered:** Employs a robust machine learning model like XGBoost for accurate and consistent predictions.

## Categories

The four categories (P1 - P4) represent different risk profiles, where:

* **P1:** Typically represents the lowest risk applicants.
* **P2:** Represents a low-to-moderate risk.
* **P3:** Represents a moderate-to-high risk.
* **P4:** Typically represents the highest risk applicants.
